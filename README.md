# Coding Dojo Solo Project

Project Idea: Travel Itinerary/Planner

Stack: JavaScript (MERN)

Description:

For my solo project I would like to create a website that helps users create a travel itinerary for their upcoming trip. I’m hoping to create this with JavaScript and deploy it when finished. This project will be a website that after a given user registers and is logged in, they can start planning their trip somewhere cool. When traveling I’ve tried different ways to create a document that has all my travel information for my upcoming trip, but I’ve noticed I’m still struggling with having to feebly locate a receipt, email of ticket info, or other information on short notice. I’m hoping with this website, the user can add all this information as they go and everything is displayed neatly and easily readable when they need to retrieve any snippet of info during their travels.
